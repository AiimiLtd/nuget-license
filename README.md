# Nuget License Utility 
Forked repo for use in InsightMaker. 

This has been done so we are able to extract licenses from the backend which allow us to include these licenses when we deploy the product.

**Usage**
First, download the release.
Extract it to your InsightMaker/scripts directory. There should now be a folder in there called NugetUtility. 
Now, when you run the build.ps1 script you are able to use the option "-ExtractLicenses".
